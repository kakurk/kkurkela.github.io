## Objective

I am currently looking to go to graduate school to study the cognitive neuroscience of memory.

## Biography

I graduated from Cornell University in 2014 with a degree in Human Development and a concentration in Developmental Behavioral Neuroscience. I spent two years after graduation working as the laboratory manager for the [Cognitive Aging and Neuroimaging Lab](http://canlab.la.psu.edu/) at Penn State University. During my time at Penn State, my research focused on the study of neural architecture underlying false memory. I spent the past two years in the [Memory Modulation Lab](http://www.thememolab.org/) at Boston College, where I continued my work studying the cognitive neuroscience of memory, focusing on the modulation of context and emotion and the neural correlates of memory using fMRI, EEG, and tDCS.

Outside of the lab I love to ski, play soccer, run, read a good book, and I am an avid soccer (Barclay's Premier League) and football (NFL) fan.
